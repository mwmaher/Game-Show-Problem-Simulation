# Game-Show-Problem-Simulation

This C program is a simulation of the game show problem.  The problem is as follows:

	You are a contestant on a popular game show.  At one point during the
	show you are given the opportunity to select one of three doors.
	Behind two of the doors is a sheep.  Behind the other door is car.
	You select a door and the show's host offers you the chance to trade
	your door for the chance to choose one of the remaining doors. What
	should you do?

  The program was written in Microsoft C 5.0 for full ANSI C compatibility.
  An ANSI C compiler should be able to compile the program. If you have any
  questions or comments I would love to here from you.
